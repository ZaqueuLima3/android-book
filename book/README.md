# Think as a Mobile Developer

Working in mobile development is not like working with the back-end or web front-end, when you are in the mobile ecosystem, you need to think in a different way.

In this book course, you will see these differences and start to think as a mobile development.

This book will not cover things like installing Android Studio, the basics of Kotlin, the basics of OOP, DS, and algorithms. If you are uncomfortable with those subjects, you can read some articles or get an online course on it, The main Idea here is to cover Android development, from the fundamental to more advanced topics.

### First, look at what you are going to see

This book is focused on using Jetpack Compose, but I think not every company is using Compose for the entire app, and maybe you need to work with the old way to create screens based on that, You will see how to create some parts of the layout in XML, but in a simple way, given that is not the focus here.

You will start with the basics of how to build an Application, so for this, you need to understand Activities and their Lifecycles, create interfaces with Fragments, and understand the Context, Live Data, Data Binding, and Navigation. That will introduce you to the Android world, But to create a more robust application, you will learn the following techs here:

- Retrofit: For API requests
- Room: For a local database
- Koin: For dependency Management
- JUnit: For unit test
- Espresso: For integration test
- UiAutomator: For e2e test
- 3rd Party Libraries

This book will be alive if you miss something, you can open an issue requesting it or even a PR writing what is missing.
